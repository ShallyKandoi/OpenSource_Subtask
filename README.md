Hello,
I am currently a fresher at IIT Guwahati.
I live in Hyderabad. My hobbies include playing chess, TT, badminton and reading novels.
Currently I am exploring and learning new things! 
The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.
I like the concept of open source as it not only helps in improvising the code but also enables other developers to learn and contribute to the existing code.
Thus I truly wish to contribute to open source to develop my skills.
